# HOW IT WORKS
This bot take token (get when you create the bot with @BotFather), your userID (get with @userinfobot) and ID of the channel ([how to find channel ID](https://gist.github.com/mraaroncruz/e76d19f7d61d59419002db54030ebe35)) on parameters to start.

When bot is started, it can be managed with the private chat open on his creation.      
This bot will check and send RSS update of feeds listed on "feed.txt".   
To optimize the process this bot check all RSS feeds every 10min and send message on channel every 30secs, to not flood channel.     

Private chat with the bot is use to manage it. The "/start" command list all command it can do.     
Warning all commands only works on the private chat with the bot, commands from channel will be ignored.     
On the private chat you can add, remove or list RSS feeds, to update feed.txt file.
